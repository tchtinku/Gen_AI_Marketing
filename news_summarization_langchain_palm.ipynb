    "It is a very common practice in real-world business scenarios to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with external sources of knowledge or applications. In a groundbreaking paper titled Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629.pdf), Google Research and Princeton University introduced a paradigm - ReAct - that combines reasoning and acting with LLMs by allowing models to interact with external environments to gather additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Langchain (https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) is a framework that allows you to create applications powered by language models. It includes extensive support for agents based on the ReAct concepts. Langchain agents use tools to interact with external systems. A tool is a component that performs a specific tasks, such as retrieving data from an external search engine. LangChain includes a number of predefined tools, such as tools for interacting with Google search, wikipedia, ArXiv, SQL databases, and many more. You can also define your own tools. "
